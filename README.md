  An advanced, single-tape, deterministic Turing Machine simulator written using the ReactJS library. Available in light and dark modes, depending on user preference. This machine is a great foundation for understanding how computer processing of algorithms works, found frequently in Computer Science majors at technical colleges.

## About the Project
I decided to create this simulator mainly for teaching purposes (mine and others). I believe it can be useful to more than one Computer Science student. I decided to use ReactJS library because of its speed and modularity, thanks to which everything is arranged in separate modules, so to speak, the simulator logic is separated from the view layer. I decided not to create an API and database, and instead add functionality to read from a file and write to a file.
The Redux library was used to manage the application state because of its high speed and stability. This keeps all the actions of the application in order, making it easy to debug the application if an error is encountered.

## Syntax and Compiler
This simulator has a syntax taken from @awmorp, slightly modified by me for ease of use. Machine has a code compiler I designed that will not allow the algorithm to run if there are any syntax errors.

## Light/Dark mode save in Local Storage
This app has a light mode and a dark mode. When the user selects a mode, it will be saved in local storage so that when the user revisits the page, the mode will automatically switch to dark or light.

## Clone and Installation
If you want to clone and work with this repository, use the built-in interface in your IDE (for example WebStorm or Visual Studio Code) or use the clone project algorithm with git bash:<br>
1. Open Git Bash.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
3. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Milosz08/ReactJS_Turing_Machine_Simulator
```
