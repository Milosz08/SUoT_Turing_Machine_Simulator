An advanced, single-tape, deterministic Turing Machine simulator written using the ReactJS library. Available in light
and dark modes, depending on user preference. This machine is a great foundation for understanding how computer processing
of algorithms works, found frequently in Computer Science majors at technical colleges.

<a name="clone-script"></a>
## Clone script
To install the program on your computer use the command (or use the built-in GIT system in your IDE environment):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Milosz08/tpr-fpr-calculator
```

<a name="webpack-scripts"></a>
## Webpack scripts
* To run webpack dev server, type:
```
$ yarn run serve
```
* To run webpack highly optimized production build, type:
```
$ yarn run build
```
Custom webpack configuration you will find in `_webpack` directory.

<a name="build-docker-container"></a>
## Build docker container
* To build image go to root project directory and type:
```
$ docker build -t turing-machine-simulator:1.0.0 .
```
* If you want use docker compose file to run container, your compose file may look like this:
```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  turing-machine-simulator:
    container_name: turing-machine-simulator
    ports:
      - '3030:80'
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```
* To run container via composer file, type:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
> NOTE: By default, application will run on NGINX http server. You can modify options in nginx.conf file (ex. change
> to reverse proxy server in production environment).

<a name="syntax-and-compiler"></a>
## Syntax and compiler
This simulator has a syntax taken from @awmorp, slightly modified by me for ease of use. Machine has a code compiler I 
designed that will not allow the algorithm to run if there are any syntax errors.
