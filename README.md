An advanced, single-tape, deterministic Turing Machine simulator written using the ReactJS library. Available in light
and dark modes, depending on user preference. This machine is a great foundation for understanding how computer processing
of algorithms works, found frequently in Computer Science majors at technical colleges.

## Clone script
To install the program on your computer use the command (or use the built-in GIT system in your IDE environment):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Milosz08/tpr-fpr-calculator
```

<a name="webpack-scripts"></a>
## Webpack scripts
* To run webpack dev server, type:
```
$ yarn run serve
```
* To run webpack highly optimized production build, type:
```
$ yarn run build
```
Custom webpack configuration you will find in `_webpack` directory.

<a name="run-with-docker-containers"></a>
## Run with Docker containers
* To compose image, type (detached with `-d` flag):
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
* To build and migrate changed content to docker container, type:
```
$ yarn run migrate
```
* To build and migrate changed content to docker container with restart Apache Web Server, type:
```
$ yarn run migrate:restart
```
> NOTE: Docker container must be running.

<a name="syntax-and-compiler"></a>
## Syntax and compiler
This simulator has a syntax taken from @awmorp, slightly modified by me for ease of use. Machine has a code compiler I 
designed that will not allow the algorithm to run if there are any syntax errors.
